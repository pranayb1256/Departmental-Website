              <p class="section-text">
                The department of Computer Science & Engineering (Artificial
                Intelligence & Machine Learning) was established in AY 2020-21. The
                department started with an intake of 60 students in UG program. The
                department has highly qualified, experienced and dedicated teaching
                faculty and supporting staffs. The department has fully equipped
                laboratories with modern and sophisticated equipment. B. E. in
                Computer Science and Engineering (Artificial Intelligence and Machine
                Learning) contains an array of courses which are related to
                computation like design and analysis of algorithms, computer
                programming languages, software design, and computer hardware. This
                program also has courses related to electronics engineering, applied
                sciences and linguistics also. Artificial Intelligence and Machine
                Learning has grown exponentially in last few years. This
                specialization is proposed to enable students to develop smart
                machines with a cutting-edge combination of AI & Data Science
                technologies like, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning,
                Statistics, Big Data Analytics, Computer Vision, Business
                Intelligence, Deep Learning and Reinforce learning, Robotics,
                Predictive Analytics using R, Swarm and Bio-inspired Intelligence,
                Robotic Process Automation, Genetic Algorithms, Fuzzy Logic and
                Systems ,Natural Language Processing, etc. Large number of IT
                companies employs huge number of computer science and IT professionals
                with expertise in the domain of AI & ML. Hence, students after
                successful completion of this course, has high prospects to get
                associated with leading Industries across the globe.
